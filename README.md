# markdownload2st
- This app display the markdown file made with [MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB)
- MarkDownload doesn't parse the scientific articles the way I want, so I made this app which cleans the markdown files  further and streamlit displays it.
- The purpose is to get a clean note that can be used for making article notes with Obsidian or to pass it through speachify.
